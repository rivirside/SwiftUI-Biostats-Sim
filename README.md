## SwiftUI-Biostats-Sim

**Features**

* Interactive Sliders: Adjust sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and population size to see how they impact the outcomes of the simulated test.
* Dynamic Charting: Visualize the results of your simulation in real-time with a bar chart that categorizes True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives.
* Detailed Metric Explanations: Get in-depth explanations for key metrics like PPV, NPV, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1 Score, MCC, Balanced Accuracy, and more.
* Composite Accuracy Display: See an immediate calculation of the overall accuracy of your simulated test.
* Expandable Metric Details: Click on any metric to toggle a dropdown that explains its calculation, interpretation, and significance.

**Key Concepts**

* **Sensitivity:** The ability of the test to correctly identify those with the disease (True Positive Rate).
* **Specificity:** The ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (True Negative Rate).
* **Prevalence:** The proportion of the population that has the disease.
* **PPV (Positive Predictive Value):** The probability that a positive test result actually indicates the presence of the disease.
* **NPV (Negative Predictive Value):** The probability that a negative test result actually indicates the absence of the disease.
* **F1 Score:** A balanced measure of Precision (PPV) and Recall (Sensitivity).
* **MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient):** A comprehensive metric that considers all four categories of the confusion matrix.
* **Balanced Accuracy:** The average of Sensitivity and Specificity.
* **False Discovery Rate (FDR):** The proportion of false positives among all positive test results.
* **AUC (Approximation):** A rough measure of the testâ€™s discriminative ability.
